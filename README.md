# java-cpp-activemq
Proof of Concept for a project including a Java web application housed in Tomcat interfacing through ActiveMQ with an application written in C++.

Environment:

Windows 7 <br/>
Java Runtime Enviroment 1.8.181 <br/>
Tomcat 9.0.10 + ActiveMQ 5.15.4 <br/>

Java web application built with JMS running on Tomcat <br/>
C++ application linked with ActiveMQ-CPP (the Apache CMS API library implementation) running on Windows <br/>

Step-by-step

1. Download and install JRE.
2. Download Tomcat and unzip it into a specific folder.
3. ****** Configure Tomcat to not pick up Jetty WebSocket ServerContainerInitializer class (See References section).
4. ****** Download ActiveMQ and unzip it into a specific folder.
5. ****** Run an ActiveMQ Broker.
5. Manually integrate Tomcat and ActiveMQ.

Note: This does allow for Topic, Queue, and ConnectionFactory injection but does not support transactional sending and delivery. You should go to Tomcat documentation and read <b>JNDI Resources HOW-TO</b>, especially part: <b>Configure Tomcat's Resource Factory</b>. ActiveMQ has ready JNDI resource factory for all its administered objects: ConnectionFactory and destinations.
You must provide it as a parameter factory for your resources:

Configure Tomcat to use the ActiveMQ resource factory in the <Context> element for the web application.

<Context>
  <Resource name="jms/ConnectionFactory" auth="Container" type="org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory" description="JMS Connection Factory" factory="org.apache.activemq.jndi.JNDIReferenceFactory" brokerURL="vm://localhost" brokerName="LocalActiveMQBroker"/>
</Context>

Configuration issues for Tomcat 7 and later.
Tomcat needs to be configured to ignore Jetty SCI annotations so that the Jetty WebSocket ServerContainerInitializer class is not inadvertently picked up by Tomcat. For more information on this problem see AMQ-6154 and https://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/HowTo/FasterStartUp and consult the Tomcat documentation for the version you are using to properly exclude the Jetty jar files from being scanned by Tomcat.

This is the top-level entry point of the documentation bundle for the Apache Tomcat Servlet/JSP container. Apache Tomcat version 9.0 implements the Servlet 4.0 and JavaServer Pages 2.3 specifications from the Java Community Process, and includes many additional features that make it a useful platform for developing and deploying web applications and web services.

Adding Custom Resource Factories. You can write your own factory and integrate it into Tomcat, and then configure the use of this factory in the <Context> element for the web application.

Apache ActiveMQ is a message broker written in Java with JMS, REST and WebSocket interfaces, however it supports protocols like AMQP, MQTT, OpenWire and STOMP that can be used by applications in different languages.

5. http://activemq.apache.org/cms/

CMS (stands for C++ Messaging Service) is a JMS-like API for C++ for interfacing with Message Brokers such as Apache ActiveMQ. CMS helps to make your C++ client code much neater and easier to follow. To get a better feel for CMS try the API Reference. ActiveMQ-CPP is a client only library, a message broker such as Apache ActiveMQ is still needed for your clients to communicate.

Our implementation of CMS is called ActiveMQ-CPP, which has an architecture that allows for pluggable transports and wire formats. Currently we support the OpenWire and Stomp protocols, both over TCP and SSL, we also now support a Failover Transport for more reliable client operation. In addition to CMS, ActiveMQ-CPP also provides a robust set of classes that support platform independent constructs such as threading, I/O, sockets, etc. You may find many of these utilities very useful, such as a Java like Thread class or the "synchronized" macro that let's you use a Java-like synchronization on any object that implements the activemq::concurrent::Synchronizable interface. ActiveMQ-CPP is released under the Apache 2.0 License.
